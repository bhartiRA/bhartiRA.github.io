I like to work logically and create new solutions to problems, making it easier, simpler, faster or better with different approaches.

Software Development  is by its nature a creative process.  When a program works correctly, it is like a huge puzzle with a lot of interdependencies working together to give a solution or a response.  The same thing can be achieved in many ways, you have to design taking in to consideration the speed required or memory limitations of a system to achieve the optimum solution.

Software Development  is a collaborative process.  You have multiple teams working together -  getting customer requirements, product development and management, testing functionality and scalability, coders doing pair programming.  It is a very satisfying experience working with a team and seeing the fruits when the software is released.

Software Development  jobs are in high demand and as such pay well.  Newer and newer systems and tasks are getting automated every day so there is no limit to the opportunities available if you are a good developer.  

Software Development  is a constantly changing field with new tools, frameworks, algorithms, languages being constantly developed.  It is a great learning experience with every program, every test you develop with different approaches with the latest relevant technologies like client/server,  webservices, data center and cloud computing .

Software Development has made the world a better place . It is a field which is changing the world and you are in it which can be a very satisfying and gratifying experience.
